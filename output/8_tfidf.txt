We know that metals have free electrons (negatively charged particles) that are responsible for their conductivity.However, the free electrons cannot normally escape out of the metal surface.If an electron attempts to come out of the metal, the metal surface acquires a positive charge  and pulls the electron back to  the metal.The free electron is thus held inside the metal surface by the attractive forces of the ions.Consequently, the electron can come out of the metal surface only if it has got sufficient energy to overcome the attractive pull.A certain minimum amount of energy is required to be given  to an electron to pull it out from the surface of the metal.This minimum energy required by an electron to escape from the metal surface is called the work function of the metal.It is generally denoted by φ0 and measured in ev (electron volt).One electron volt is the energy gained by an electron when it has been accelerated by  a  potential difference  of 1 volt, so that  1 eV = 1.602 ×10–19 J.
We now study the relation between the frequency ν of the incident radiation and the stopping potential V0.We suitably adjust the same intensity of light radiation at various frequencies and study the variation of photocurrent with collector plate potential.The resulting variation is shown in Fig.11.4.We obtain different values of stopping potential but the same value of the saturation current for incident radiation of different frequencies.The energy of the emitted electrons depends on the frequency of the incident radiations.The stopping potential is more negative for higher frequencies of incident radiation.Note from Fig.11.4  that the stopping potentials are in the order V03 > V02 > V01 if the frequencies are in the order ν3 > ν2 > ν1 .This implies that greater the frequency of incident light, greater is the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons.Consequently, we need greater retarding potential to stop them completely.If we plot a graph between the frequency of incident radiation and the corresponding stopping potential for different metals we get a straight line, as shown in Fig.11.5.
The experimental arrange-ment used by Davisson and Germer is schematically shown in Fig.11.7.It consists of an electron gun which comprises of a tungsten filament F, coated with barium oxide and heated by a low voltage power supply (L.T.or battery).Electrons emitted by the filament are accelerated to a desired velocity by applying suitable potential/voltage from a high voltage power supply (H.T.or battery).They are made to pass through a cylinder with fine holes along its axis, producing a fine collimated beam.The beam is made to fall on the surface of a nickel crystal.The electrons are scattered in all directions by the atoms of the crystal.The intensity of the electron beam, scattered in a given direction, is measured by the electron detector (collector).The detector can be moved on a circular scale and is connected to a sensitive galvanometer, which records the current.The deflection of the galvanometer is proportional to the intensity of the electron beam entering the collector.The  apparatus is enclosed in an evacuated chamber.By moving the  detector  on the circular scale at different positions, the intensity of the scattered electron beam is measured for different values of angle of scattering θ which is the angle between the incident and the scattered electron beams.The variation of the intensity (I) of the scattered electrons with the angle of scattering θ  is obtained for different accelerating voltages.
We first keep the plate A at some positive potential with respect to the plate C and illuminate the plate C with light of fixed frequency ν  and fixed intensity I1.We next vary the positive potential of plate A gradually and measure the resulting photocurrent each time.It is found that the photoelectric current increases with increase in positive (accelerating) potential.At some stage, for a certain positive potential of plate A, all the emitted electrons are  collected by the plate A and the photoelectric current becomes maximum or  saturates.If we increase the accelerating potential of plate A further, the photocurrent does not increase.This maximum value of the photoelectric current is called  saturation current.Saturation current corresponds to the case when all the photoelectrons emitted by the emitter plate C reach the collector plate A.
Lenard (1862-1947) observed that when ultraviolet radiations were allowed to fall on the emitter plate of an evacuated glass tube enclosing two electrodes (metal plates), current flows in the circuit (Fig.11.1).As soon as the ultraviolet radiations were stopped, the current flow also stopped.These observations indicate that when ultraviolet radiations fall on the emitter plate C, electrons are ejected from it which are attracted towards the positive, collector plate A by the electric field.The electrons flow through the evacuated glass tube, resulting in the current flow.Thus, light falling on the surface of the emitter causes current in the external circuit.Hallwachs and Lenard studied how this photo current varied with collector plate potential, and with frequency and intensity of incident light.
We can now repeat this experiment with incident radiation of the same frequency but of higher intensity I2 and I3 (I3 > I2 > I1).We note that the saturation currents are now found to be at higher values.This shows that more electrons are being emitted per second, proportional to the intensity of incident radiation.But the stopping potential remains the same as that for the incident radiation of intensity I1, as shown graphically in Fig.11.3.Thus, for a given frequency of the incident radiation, the stopping potential is independent of its intensity.In other words, the maximum kinetic energy of photoelectrons depends on the light source and the emitter plate material, but is independent of intensity of incident radiation.
According to the wave picture of light, the free electrons at the surface of the metal (over which the beam of radiation falls) absorb the radiant energy continuously.The greater the intensity of radiation, the greater are the amplitude of electric and magnetic fields.Consequently, the greater the intensity, the greater should be the energy absorbed by each electron.In this picture, the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons on the surface is then expected to increase with increase in intensity.Also, no matter what the frequency of radiation is, a sufficiently intense beam of radiation (over sufficient time) should be able to impart enough energy to the electrons, so that they exceed the minimum energy needed to escape from the metal surface .A threshold frequency, therefore, should not exist.These expectations of the wave theory directly contradict observations (i), (ii) and (iii) given at the end of sub-section 11.4.3.
After the discovery of the electron in 1897, it became evident that the incident light causes electrons to be emitted from the emitter plate.Due to negative charge, the emitted electrons are pushed towards the collector plate by the electric field.Hallwachs and  Lenard also observed that when ultraviolet light fell on the emitter plate, no electrons were emitted at all when the frequency of the incident light was smaller than a certain minimum value, called the threshold frequency.This minimum frequency depends on the nature of the material of the emitter plate.
•	In Einstein’s picture, the basic elementary process involved in photoelectric effect is the absorption of a light quantum by an electron.This process is instantaneous.Thus, whatever may be the intensity i.e., the number of quanta of radiation per unit area per unit time, photoelectric emission is instantaneous.Low intensity does not mean delay in emission, since the basic elementary process is the same.Intensity only determines how many electrons are able to participate in the elementary process (absorption of a light quantum by a single electron) and, therefore, the photoelectric current.
In 1924, de Broglie proposed his theory of wave-particle duality in which he said that not only photons of light but also ‘particles’ of matter such as electrons and atoms possess a dual character, sometimes behaving like a particle and sometimes as a wave.He gave a formula connecting their mass, velocity, momentum (particle characteristics), with their wavelength and frequency (wave characteristics)!In 1927 Thomson, and Davisson and Germer, in separate experiments, showed that electrons did behave like waves with a wavelength which agreed with that given by de Broglie’s formula.Their experiment was on diffraction of electrons through crystalline solids, in which the regular arrangement of atoms acted like a grating.Very soon, diffraction experiments with other ‘particles’ such as neutrons and protons were performed and these too confirmed with de Broglie’s formula.This confirmed wave-particle duality as an established principle of physics.Here was a principle, physicists thought, which explained all the phenomena mentioned above not only for light but also for the so-called particles.
The collector A is maintained at a positive potential with respect to emitter C so that electrons ejected from C are attracted towards collector A.Keeping the frequency of the incident radiation and the potential fixed, the intensity of light is varied and the resulting photoelectric current is measured each time.It is found that the photocurrent increases linearly with intensity of incident light as shown graphically in Fig.11.2.The photocurrent is directly  proportional to the number of photoelectrons emitted per second.This implies that the number of photoelectrons emitted per second is directly proportional to the intensity of incident radiation.
In 1905, Albert Einstein (1879-1955) proposed a radically new picture of electromagnetic radiation to explain photoelectric effect.In this picture, photoelectric emission does not take place by continuous absorption of energy from radiation.Radiation energy is built up of discrete units – the so called quanta of energy of radiation.Each quantum of radiant energy has energy hν, where h is Planck’s constant and ν the frequency of light.In photoelectric effect, an electron absorbs a quantum of energy (hν) of radiation.
The Maxwell’s equations of electromagnetism and Hertz experiments on the generation and detection of electromagnetic waves in 1887 strongly established the wave nature of light.Towards the same period at the end of 19th century, experimental investigations on conduction of electricity (electric discharge) through gases at low pressure in a discharge tube led to many historic discoveries.The discovery of X-rays by Roentgen in 1895, and of electron by J. J. Thomson in 1897, were important milestones in the understanding of atomic structure.It was found that at sufficiently low pressure of about 0.001 mm of mercury column, a discharge took place between the two electrodes on applying the electric field to the gas in the discharge tube.A fluorescent glow appeared on the glass opposite to cathode.The colour of glow of the glass depended on the type of glass, it  being  yellowish-green for soda glass.The cause of this fluorescence was attributed to the radiation which appeared to be coming from the cathode.These cathode rays were discovered, in 1870, by William Crookes who later, in 1879, suggested that these rays consisted of streams of fast moving negatively charged particles.The British physicist J. J. Thomson (1856-1940) confirmed this hypothesis.By applying mutually perpendicular electric and magnetic fields across the discharge tube, J. J. Thomson was the first to determine experimentally the speed and the specific charge [charge to mass ratio (e/m)] of the cathode ray particles.They were found to travel with speeds ranging from about 0.1 to 0.2 times the speed of light (3 ×108 m/s).The presently accepted value of e/m is 1.76 × 10­11 C/kg.Further, the value of e/m was found to be independent of the nature of the material/metal used as the cathode (emitter), or the gas introduced in the discharge tube.This observation suggested the universality of the cathode ray particles.
Further, we should note that in the wave picture, the absorption of energy by electron takes place continuously over the entire wavefront of the radiation.Since a large number of electrons absorb energy, the energy absorbed per electron per unit time turns out to be small.Explicit calculations estimate that it can take hours or more for a single electron to pick up sufficient energy to overcome the work function and come out of the metal.This conclusion is again in striking contrast to observation (iv) that the photoelectric emission is instantaneous.In short, the wave picture is unable to explain the most basic features of  photoelectric  emission.
We now apply a negative (retarding) potential to the plate A with respect to the plate C and make it increasingly negative gradually.When the polarity is reversed, the electrons are repelled and only the most energetic electrons are able to reach the collector A.The photocurrent is found to decrease rapidly until it drops to zero at a certain sharply defined, critical value of the negative potential V0 on the plate A.For a particular frequency of incident radiation, the minimum negative (retarding) potential V0 given to the plate A for which the photocurrent stops or becomes zero is called the cut-off or stopping potential.
It was found that certain metals like zinc, cadmium, magnesium, etc., responded only to ultraviolet light, having short wavelength, to cause electron emission from the surface.However, some alkali metals such as lithium, sodium, potassium, caesium and rubidium were sensitive even to visible light.All these photosensitive substances emit electrons when they are illuminated by light.After the discovery of electrons, these electrons were termed as photoelectrons.The phenomenon is called  photoelectric effect.
Albert Einstein (1879 – 1955) Einstein, one of the greatest physicists of all time, was born in Ulm, Germany.In 1905, he published three path-breaking papers.In the first paper, he introduced the notion of light quanta (now called photons) and used it to explain the features of photoelectric effect.In the second paper, he developed a theory of Brownian motion, confirmed experimentally a few years later and provided a convincing evidence of the atomic picture of matter.The third paper gave birth to the special theory of relativity.In 1916, he published the general theory of relativity.Some of Einstein’s most significant later contributions are: the notion of stimulated emission introduced in an alternative derivation of Planck’s blackbody radiation law, static model of the universe which started modern cosmology, quantum statistics of a gas of massive bosons, and a critical analysis of the foundations of quantum mechanics.In 1921, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics for his contribution to theoretical physics and the photoelectric effect.
It is worth pausing here to reflect on just what a matter wave associated with a particle, say, an electron, means.Actually, a truly satisfactory physical understanding of the dual nature of matter and radiation has not emerged so far.The great founders of quantum mechanics (Niels Bohr, Albert Einstein, and many others) struggled with this and related concepts for long.Still the deep physical interpretation of quantum mechanics continues to be an area of active research.Despite this, the concept of matter wave has been mathematically introduced in modern quantum mechanics with great success.An important milestone in this connection was when Max Born (1882-1970) suggested a probability interpretation to the matter wave amplitude.According to this, the intensity (square of the amplitude) of the matter wave at a point determines the probability density of the particle at that point.Probability density means probability per unit volume.Thus, if A is the amplitude of the wave at a point, |A|2 ∆V is the probability of the particle being found in a small volume ∆V around that point.Thus, if the intensity of matter wave is large in a certain region, there is a greater probability of the particle being found there than where the intensity is small.
(iii)	For a given photosensitive material, there exists a certain minimum cut-off frequency of the incident radiation, called the threshold frequency, below which no emission of photoelectrons takes place, no matter how intense the incident light is.Above the threshold frequency, the stopping potential or equivalently the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted photoelectrons increases linearly with the frequency of the incident radiation, but is independent of its intensity (Fig.11.5).
Is the light quantum of energy to be associated with a particle?Einstein arrived at the important result, that the light quantum can also be associated with momentum (h ν/c).A definite value of energy as well as momentum is a strong sign that the light quantum can be associated with a particle.This particle was later named photon.The particle-like behaviour of light was further confirmed, in 1924, by the experiment of A.H. Compton (1892-1962) on scattering of X-rays from electrons.In 1921, Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his contribution to theoretical physics and the photoelectric effect.In 1923, Millikan was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics for his work on the elementary charge of electricity and on the photoelectric effect.
Light shining on the metal surface somehow facilitated the escape of free, charged particles which we now know as electrons.When light falls on a metal surface, some electrons near the surface absorb enough energy from the incident radiation to overcome the attraction of the positive ions in the material of the surface.After gaining sufficient energy from the incident light, the electrons escape from the surface of the metal into the surrounding space.
J. Thomson, in 1897, named these particles as electrons, and suggested that they were fundamental, universal  constituents of matter.For his epoch-making discovery of electron, through his theoretical and experimental investigations on conduction of electricity by gasses, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1906.In 1913, the American physicist R. A. Millikan (1868-1953) performed the pioneering oil-drop experiment for the precise measurement of the charge on an electron.He found that  the charge on an oil-droplet was always an integral multiple of an elementary charge, 1.602 × 10–19 C. Millikan’s experiment established that electric charge is quantised.From the values of charge (e) and specific charge (e/m), the mass (m) of the electron could be determined.
•	In this picture, intensity of radiation as noted above, is proportional to the number of energy quanta per unit area per unit time.The greater the number of energy quanta available, the greater is the number of electrons absorbing the energy quanta  and greater, therefore, is the number of electrons coming out of the metal (for ν > ν0).This explains why, for ν > ν0 , photoelectric current is proportional to intensity.
(11.2), Kmax depends linearly on ν, and is independent of intensity of radiation, in agreement with observation.This has happened because in Einstein’s picture, photoelectric effect arises from the absorption of a single quantum of radiation by a single electron.The intensity of radiation (that is proportional to the number of energy quanta per unit area per unit time) is irrelevant to this basic process.
Thus, there is an excellent agreement between the theoretical value and the experimentally obtained value of de Broglie wavelength.Davisson-Germer experiment thus strikingly confirms the wave nature of electrons and the de Broglie relation.More recently, in 1989, the wave nature of a beam of electrons was experimentally demonstrated in a double-slit experiment, similar to that used for the wave nature of light.Also, in an experiment in 1994, interference fringes were obtained with the beams of iodine molecules, which are about a million times more massive than electrons.
(11.11) gives  λ  = 0.112 nm.This wavelength is of the same order as the spacing between the atomic planes in crystals.This suggests that matter waves associated with an electron could be verified by crystal diffraction experiments analogous to X-ray diffraction.We describe the experimental verification of the de Broglie hypothesis in the next section.In 1929, de Broglie was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery of the wave nature of electrons.
More tightly bound electrons will emerge with kinetic energies less than the maximum value.Note that the intensity of light of a given frequency is determined by the number of photons incident per second.Increasing the intensity will increase the number of emitted electrons per second.However, the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted photoelectrons is determined by the energy of each photon.
In scientific work, photo cells are used whenever it is necessary to measure the intensity of light.Light meters in photographic cameras make use of photo cells to measure the intensity of incident light.The photocells, inserted in the door light electric circuit, are used as automatic door opener.A person approaching a doorway may interrupt a light beam which is incident on a photocell.The abrupt change in photocurrent may be used to start a motor which opens the door or rings an alarm.They are used in the control of a counting device which records every interruption of the light beam caused by a person or object passing across the beam.So photocells help count the persons entering an auditorium, provided they enter the hall one by one.They are used for detection of traffic law defaulters: an alarm may be sounded whenever a beam of (invisible) radiation is intercepted.
Every body at any temperature emits radiation of all wavelengths.It also absorbs radiation falling on it.A body which absorbs all the radiation falling on it is called a black body.It is an ideal concept in physics, like concepts of a point mass or uniform motion.A graph of the intensity of radiation emitted by a body versus wavelength is called the black body spectrum.No theory in those days could explain the complete black body spectrum!
(iii)	All photons of light of a particular frequency  ν, or wavelength λ, have the same energy E (=hν = hc/λ) and momentum  p (= hν/c= h/λ), whatever the intensity of radiation may be.By increasing the intensity of light of given wavelength, there is only an increase in the number of photons per second crossing a given area, with each photon having the same energy.Thus, photon energy is independent of intensity of radiation.
The successful explanation of photoelectric effect using the hypothesis of light quanta and the experimental determination of values of h and φ0, in agreement with values obtained from other experiments, led to the acceptance of Einstein’s picture of photoelectric effect.Millikan verified photoelectric equation with great precision, for a number of alkali metals over a wide range of radiation frequencies.
Hallwachs, in 1888, undertook the study further and connected a negatively charged zinc plate to an electroscope.He observed that the zinc plate lost its charge when it was illuminated by ultraviolet light.Further, the uncharged zinc plate became positively charged when it was irradiated by ultraviolet light.Positive charge on a  positively charged zinc plate was found to be further enhanced when it was illuminated by ultraviolet light.From these observations he concluded that negatively charged particles were emitted from the zinc plate under the action of ultraviolet light.
In 1900, Planck hit upon a novel idea.If we assume, he said, that radiation is emitted in packets of energy instead of continuously as in a wave, then we can explain the black body spectrum.Planck himself regarded these quanta, or packets, as a property of emission and absorption, rather than that of light.He derived a formula which agreed with the entire spectrum.This was a confusing mixture of wave and particle pictures – radiation is emitted as a particle, it travels as a wave, and is again absorbed as a particle!Moreover, this put physicists in a dilemma.Should we again accept the particle picture of light just to explain one phenomenon?Then what happens to the phenomena of interference and diffraction which cannot be explained by the particle model?
(iii)	Photoelectric emission: When light of suitable frequency illuminates a metal surface, electrons are emitted from the metal surface.These photo(light)-generated electrons are called photoelectrons.
(b)	de Broglie wavelength of the electrons accelerated through a potential difference of 56 V.
(c) 	de Broglie wavelength of an electron with kinetic energy of 120 eV.
(b)	For a photoelectric device to operate, we require incident light energy E to be equal to or greater than the work function φ0 of the material.Thus, the photoelectric device will operate with violet light (with E = 3.19 eV) photosensitive material Na (with φ0 = 2.75 eV), K (with φ0 = 2.30 eV) and Cs (with φ0 = 2.14 eV).It will also operate with yellow-green light (with E = 2.26 eV) for Cs (with φ0 = 2.14 eV) only.However, it will not operate with red light (with E = 1.64 eV) for any of these photosensitive materials.
A photocell is a technological application of the photoelectric effect.It is a device whose electrical properties are affected by light.It is also sometimes called an electric eye.A photocell consists of a semi-cylindrical photo-sensitive metal plate C (emitter) and a wire loop A (collector) supported in an evacuated glass or quartz bulb.It is connected to the external circuit having a high-tension battery B and microammeter (µA) as shown in the Figure.Sometimes, instead of the plate C, a thin layer of photosensitive material is pasted on the inside of the bulb.A part of the bulb is left clean for the light to enter it.
But there was no basic theoretical foundation for wave-particle duality.De Broglie’s proposal was merely a qualitative argument based on symmetry of nature.Wave-particle duality was at best a principle, not an outcome of a sound fundamental theory.It is true that all experiments whatever agreed with de Broglie formula.But physics does not work that way.On the one hand, it needs experimental confirmation, while on the other hand, it also needs sound theoretical basis for the models proposed.This was developed over the next two decades.Dirac developed his theory of radiation in about 1928, and Heisenberg and Pauli gave it a firm footing by 1930.Tomonaga, Schwinger, and Feynman, in late 1940s, produced further refinements and cleared the theory of inconsistencies which were noticed.All these theories mainly put wave-particle duality on a theoretical footing.
The dual (wave-particle) nature of light (electromagnetic radiation, in general) comes out clearly from what we have learnt in this and the preceding chapters.The wave nature of light shows up in the phenomena of interference, diffraction and polarisation.On the other hand, in photoelectric effect and Compton effect which involve energy and momentum transfer, radiation behaves as if it is made up of a bunch of particles – the photons.Whether a particle or wave description is best suited for understanding an experiment depends on the nature of the experiment.For example, in the familiar  phenomenon of seeing an object by our eye, both descriptions are important.The gathering and focussing mechanism of light by the eye-lens is well described in the wave picture.But its absorption by the rods and cones (of the retina) requires the photon picture of light.
Equation (11.3) shows that the greater the work function φ0, the higher the minimum or threshold frequency ν0 needed to emit photoelectrons.Thus, there exists a threshold frequency ν0 (= φ0/h) for the metal surface, below which no photoelectric  emission is possible, no matter how intense the incident radiation may be or how long it falls on the surface.
Note that in all the above experiments, it is found that, if frequency of the incident radiation exceeds the threshold frequency, the photoelectric emission starts instantaneously without any apparent time lag, even if the incident radiation is very dim.It is now known that emission starts in a time of the order of 10–9 s or less.
The wave nature of electrons was first experimentally verified by C.J.Davisson and L.H.Germer in 1927 and independently by G.P.Thomson, in 1928, who observed diffraction effects with beams of electrons scattered by crystals.Davisson and Thomson shared the Nobel Prize in 1937 for their experimental discovery of diffraction of electrons by crystals.
The de Broglie hypothesis has been basic to the development of modern quantum mechanics.It has also led to the field of electron optics.The wave properties of electrons have been utilised in the design of electron microscope which is a great improvement, with higher resolution, over the optical microscope.
(ii)	For a given photosensitive material and frequency of incident radiation, saturation current is found to be proportional to the intensity of incident radiation whereas the stopping potential is independent of its intensity (Fig.11.3).
This photoelectric equation explains all the features of the photoelectric effect.Millikan’s first precise measurements confirmed the Einstein’s photoelectric equation and obtained an accurate value of Planck’s constant h. This led to the acceptance of particle or photon description (nature) of electromagnetic radiation, introduced by Einstein.
Now, if an electron has a definite momentum p, (i.e.∆p = 0), by the de Broglie relation, it has a definite wavelength λ.A wave of definite (single) wavelength extends all over space.By Born’s probability interpretation this means that the electron is not localised in any finite region of space.That is, its position uncertainty is infinite (∆x → ∞), which is consistent with the uncertainty principle.
(i)	For a given photosensitive material and frequency of incident radiation (above the threshold frequency), the photoelectric current is directly proportional to the intensity of incident light (Fig.11.2).
where m  is the mass of the particle and v its speed.Equation (11.5) is known as the de Broglie relation and the wavelength λ of the matter wave is called de Broglie wavelength.The dual aspect of matter is evident in the de Broglie relation.On the left hand side of Eq.
Na: 2.75 eV; K: 2.30 eV; Mo: 4.17 eV; Ni: 5.15 eV.Which of these metals will not give photoelectric emission for a radiation of wavelength 3300 Å from a He-Cd laser placed 1 m away from the photocell?What happens if the laser is brought nearer and placed 50 cm away?
This is an important result.It predicts that the V0 versus ν  curve is a straight line with slope = (h/e), independent of the nature of the material.During 1906-1916, Millikan performed a series of experiments on photoelectric effect, aimed at disproving Einstein’s photoelectric equation.He measured the slope of the straight line obtained for sodium, similar to that shown in Fig.11.5.Using the known value of e, he determined the value of Planck’s constant h. This value was close to the value of Planck’s contant (= 6.626 × 10–34J s) determined in an entirely different context.In this way, in 1916, Millikan proved the validity of Einstein’s photoelectric equation, instead of disproving it.
[Note: Exercises 11.35 and 11.36 reveal that while the wave-packets associated with gaseous molecules under ordinary conditions are non-overlapping, the electron wave-packets in a metal strongly overlap with one another.This suggests that whereas molecules in an ordinary gas can be distinguished apart, electrons in a metal cannot be distintguished apart from one another.
By de Broglie’s relation, then, the momentum of the electron will also have a spread – an uncertainty ∆p.This is as expected from the uncertainty principle.It can be shown that the wave packet description together with de Broglie relation and Born’s probability interpretation reproduce the Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle exactly.
(b)	Also find the de Broglie wavelength of a neutron, in thermal equilibrium with matter, having an average kinetic energy of (3/2) k T at 300 K.
(b)	Use the same formula you employ in (a) to obtain electron speed for an collector potential of 10 MV.Do you see what is wrong ?In what way is the formula to be modified?
In burglar alarm, (invisible) ultraviolet light is continuously made to fall on a photocell installed at the doorway.A person entering the door interrupts the beam falling on the photocell.The abrupt change in photocurrent is used to start an electric bell ringing.In fire alarm, a number of photocells are installed at suitable places in a building.In the event of breaking out of fire, light radiations fall upon the photocell.This completes the electric circuit through an electric bell or a siren which starts operating as a warning signal.
But soon in 1905, Einstein explained the photoelectric effect by assuming the particle picture of light.In 1907, Debye explained the low temperature specific heats of solids by using the particle picture for lattice vibrations in a crystalline solid.Both these phenomena belonging to widely diverse areas of physics could be explained only by the particle model and not by the wave model.In 1923, Compton’s x-ray scattering experiments from atoms also went in favour of the particle picture.This increased the dilemma further.
also exhibit wave-like character?In 1924, the French physicist Louis Victor de Broglie (pronounced as de Broy) (1892-1987) put forward the bold hypothesis that moving particles of matter should display wave-like properties under suitable conditions.He reasoned that nature was symmetrical and that the two basic physical entities – matter and energy, must have symmetrical character.If radiation shows dual aspects, so should matter.
(ii) For a frequency ν of incident radiation, lower than the cut-off frequency ν0, no photoelectric emission is possible even if the intensity is large.
Louis Victor de Broglie (1892 – 1987) French physicist who put forth revolutionary idea of wave nature of matter.This idea was developed by Erwin Schródinger into a full-fledged theory of quantum mechanics commonly known as wave mechanics.In 1929, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery of the wave nature of electrons.
In general, the matter wave associated with the electron is not extended all over space.It is a wave packet extending over some finite region of space.In that case ∆x is not infinite but has some finite value depending on the extension of the wave packet.Also, you must appreciate that a wave packet of finite extension does not have a single wavelength.It is built up of wavelengths spread around some central wavelength.
The phenomenon of photoelectric emission was discovered in 1887 by Heinrich Hertz (1857-1894), during his electromagnetic wave experiments.In his experimental investigation on the production of electromagnetic waves by means of a spark discharge, Hertz observed that high voltage sparks across the detector loop were enhanced when the emitter plate was illuminated by ultraviolet light from an arc lamp.
The appearance of the peak in a particular direction is due to the constructive interference of electrons scattered from different layers of the regularly spaced atoms of the crystals.From the electron diffraction measurements, the wavelength of matter waves was found to be 0.165 nm.
Two models of light were also proposed in the seventeenth century.Descartes, in early decades of seventeenth century, proposed that light consists of particles, while Huygens, around 1650-60, proposed that light consists of waves.Descartes′ proposal was merely a philosophical model, devoid of any experiments or scientific arguments.Newton soon after, around 1660-70, extended Descartes′ particle model, known as corpuscular theory, built it up as a scientific theory, and explained various known properties with it.These models, light as waves and as particles, in a sense, are quite opposite of each other.But both models could explain all the known properties of light.There was nothing to choose between them.
The de Broglie wavelength of electron is comparable with X-ray wavelengths.However, for the ball it is about 10–19 times the size of the proton, quite beyond experimental measurement.
Better experiments were performed in the nineteenth century to determine the speed of light.With more accurate experiments, a value of 3×108 m/s for speed of light in vacuum was arrived at.Around 1860, Maxwell proposed his equations of electromagnetism and it was realized that all electromagnetic phenomena known at that time could be explained by Maxwell’s four equations.Soon Maxwell showed that electric and magnetic fields could propagate through empty space (vacuum) in the form of electromagnetic waves.He calculated the speed of these waves and arrived at a theoretical value of 2.998×108  m/s.The close agreement of this value with the experimental value suggested that light consists of electromagnetic waves.In 1887 Hertz demonstrated the generation and detection of such waves.This established the wave theory of light on a firm footing.We might say that while eighteenth century belonged to the particle model, the nineteenth century belonged to the wave model of light.
The wave nature of light was well established by the end of the nineteenth century.The phenomena of interference, diffraction and polarisation were explained in a natural and satisfactory way by the wave picture of light.According to this picture, light is an electromagnetic wave consisting  of electric and magnetic fields with continuous distribution of energy over the region of space over which the wave is extended.Let us now see if this wave picture of light can explain the observations on photoelectric  emission given in the previous section.
Then in 1801, Young performed his double-slit experiment and observed interference fringes.This phenomenon could be explained only by wave theory.It was realized that diffraction was also another phenomenon which could be explained only by wave theory.In fact, it was a natural consequence of Huygens idea of secondary wavelets emanating from every point in the path of light.These experiments could not be explained by assuming that light consists of particles.Another phenomenon of polarisation was discovered around 1810, and this too could be naturally explained by the wave theory.Thus wave theory of Huygens came to the forefront and Newton’s particle theory went into the background.This situation again continued for almost a century.
(v) In a photon-particle collision (such as photon-electron collision), the total energy and total momentum are conserved.However, the number of photons may not be conserved in a collision.The photon may be absorbed or a new photon may be created.
The de Broglie wavelength associated with an electron in this case is of the order of X-ray wavelengths.
Around the same time, in 1887, it was found that certain metals, when irradiated by ultraviolet light, emitted negatively charged particles having small speeds.Also, certain metals when heated to a high temperature were found to emit negatively charged particles.The value of e/m of these particles was found to be the same as that for cathode ray particles.These observations thus established that all these particles, although produced under different conditions, were identical in nature.J.
(a)	The number of photons emitted per second by a Medium wave transmitter of 10 kW power, emitting radiowaves of wavelength 500 m.
(b) The number of photons entering the pupil of our eye per second corresponding to the minimum intensity of white light that we humans can perceive (∼10–10 W m–2).Take the area of the pupil to be about 0.4 cm2, and the average frequency of white light to be about 6 × 1014 Hz.
(ii)	Field emission: By applying a very strong electric field (of the order of 108 V m–1) to a metal, electrons can be pulled out of the metal, as in a spark plug.
For the same kinetic energy K, the de Broglie wavelength associated with the particle is inversely proportional to the square root of their masses.A proton  is 1836 times massive than an electron and an α-particle  four times that of a proton.
(c) There were some phenomena such as black body radiation, photoelectric effect, and Compton scattering which could be explained only by the particle model but not by the wave model.Somebody in those days aptly remarked that light behaves as a particle on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, and as a wave on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, and we don’t talk of light on Sundays!
(d)	Every metal has a definite work function.Why do all photoelectrons not come out with the same energy if incident radiation is monochromatic?Why is there an energy distribution of photoelectrons?
(i)	The maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons varies linearly with the frequency of incident radiation, but is independent of its intensity.
(iv)	The photoelectric emission is an instantaneous process without any apparent time lag (∼10–9s or less), even when the incident radiation is made exceedingly dim.
Different photosensitive materials respond differently to light.Selenium is more sensitive than zinc or copper.The same photosensitive substance  gives different response to light of different wavelengths.For example, ultraviolet light gives rise to  photoelectric effect in copper  while green or red light does not.
(b)	Obtain the de Broglie wavelength associated with thermal neutrons at room temperature (27 °C).Hence explain why a fast neutron beam needs to be thermalised with the environment before it can be used for neutron diffraction experiments.
The de Broglie wavelength λ associated with electrons, using Eq.
(i)	the stopping potential V0 varies linearly with the frequency of incident radiation for a given photosensitive material.
Photoelectric effect involves conversion of light energy into electrical energy.It follows the law of conservation of energy.The photoelectric emission is an instantaneous process and possesses certain special features.
A photocell converts a change in intensity of illumination into a change in photocurrent.This current can be used to operate control systems and in light measuring devices.A photocell of lead sulphide sensitive to infrared radiation is used in electronic ignition circuits.
When light of suitable wavelength falls on the emitter C, photoelectrons are emitted.These photoelectrons are drawn to the collector A. Photocurrent of the order of a few microampere can be normally obtained from a photo cell.
The matter–wave picture elegantly incorporated the Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle.According to the principle, it is not possible to measure both the position and momentum of an electron (or any other particle) at the same time exactly.There is always some uncertainty (∆ x) in the specification of position and some uncertainty (∆p) in the specification of momentum.
In Chapter 12, the de Broglie relation will be seen to justify Bohr’s postulate on quantisation of angular momentum of electron in an atom.
(i)	Thermionic emission: By suitably heating, sufficient thermal energy can be imparted to the free electrons to enable them to come out of the metal.
(i) In interaction of radiation with matter, radiation behaves as if it is made up of particles called photons.
(11.5) equals the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation of which the photon is a quantum of energy and momentum.
Equation (11.2) is known as Einstein’s photoelectric equation.We now see how this equation accounts in a simple and elegant manner all the observations on photoelectric effect given at the end of  sub-section 11.4.3.
Although the story continues, it grows more and more complex and beyond the scope of this note.But we have here the essential structure of what happened, and let us be satisfied with it at the moment.Now it is regarded as a natural consequence of present theories of physics that electromagnetic radiation as well as particles of matter exhibit both wave and particle properties in different experiments, and sometimes even in the different parts of the same experiment.
This unit of energy is commonly used in atomic and nuclear physics.The work function (φ0)  depends on the properties of the metal and the nature of its surface.The values of work function of some metals are given in Table 11.1.These values are approximate as they are very sensitive to surface impurities.
Photoelectric effect thus gave evidence to the strange fact that light in interaction with matter behaved as if it was made of quanta or packets of energy, each of energy h ν.
This minimum, cut-off frequency ν0, is called the threshold frequency.It is different for different metals.
The interpretation of the observation in terms of photoelectrons is straightforward.All the photoelectrons emitted from the metal do not have the same energy.
That is, the de Broglie wavelength of a photon given by Eq.
(b)	minimum wavelength of X-rays produced by 30 kV electrons.
(b)	Photocurrent reduces to zero, when maximum kinetic energy of the emitted photoelectrons equals the potential energy e V0 by the retarding potential V0.
The history of the development of these models over the next few centuries is interesting.Bartholinus, in 1669, discovered double refraction of light in some crystals, and Huygens, in 1678, was quick to explain it on the basis of his wave theory of light.In spite of this, for over one hundred years, Newton’s particle model was firmly believed and preferred over the wave model.This was partly because of its simplicity and partly because of Newton’s influence on contemporary physics.
Vast amounts of experiments were done during the period 1850-1900 on heat and related phenomena, an altogether different area of physics.Theories and models like kinetic theory and thermodynamics were developed which quite successfully explained the various phenomena, except one.
(b)	a neutron, would have the same de Broglie wavelength.
